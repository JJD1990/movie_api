Requirements
Retrieve data for the Best Motion Picture of the Year nominees from this year’s Oscars using the The Open Movie Database
API (https://www.omdbapi.com/)
The list of nominees can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/oscars/event/ev0000003/2025/1/
Store the retrieved data in a database.
The following fields should be stored for each movie:
Title
Year
Rating
Runtime
Director
Actors should be stored in a separate model, with an appropriate association to the movie model (i.e., a movie has many actors).
Create a basic web page displaying the movies in a table.
The table should include title, year, rating, runtime, and director.
The design doesn’t need to be polished, but it should be functional.
You may use any frontend framework or plain HTML/CSS.
